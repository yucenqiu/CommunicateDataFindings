# FordGoBike Data Exploration

## Dataset

This dataset contains bike sharing information posted in the month of April by Bay Wheels, formerly known as FordGoBike. This data set contains approximately 239,000 individual entries of users posting their data regarding their bike rides.

## Summary of Findings

- The most popular times for riding a bike is usually from 8:00-9:00 am and 5:00-6:00 pm.
- The most popular days for bike riding is Tuesday, but the weekdays are closely behind with a falloff on the weekends.
- There are very low latitudinal and longitudinal movement for the bike users.
- The median duration of the bike rides are longer during the weekends than the weekdays.

## Key Insights for Presentation

- Customers are likely to ride bikes across all days of the week, while subscribers are more likely to ride bikes during the weekdays
- Changes in starting and ending latitude and longitude may not accurately reflect how much distance is traveled.
- A high percentage of customers and subscribers use bikes for travel during the rush hours(8:00-9:00am and 5:00-6:00pm).
